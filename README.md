The project is for creating and registering for events

#### Project Description
One of the key indices that an event was successful is determined by the turn-up of attendees. It is demoralizing to organizers after having put on good effort in ensuring their event was well attended to see handful of persons gracing the occasion.

Event Maker is a platform for event organizers to leverage, to ensure the outcome of the event as regards attendee is a win-win situation and yet delivered in exciting manner.

A fixed small amount is charged from attendees and deposited in a pool. 90% deposit of people that RSVPed but could not make it are shared equally among the checked in attendee after, while 10% would be used as service fee from pool of the persons that could not make it to the event.

Event managers can create an event, see numbers of attendees that RSVPed and the attendees that checked in.

Before anyone is check in, the attendee has to provide a unique generated code by the system to the event owner.

Anyone can see listed events.

Connected wallets should be able to see their event histories.

Event owner should be able to - Create an event - See numbers of persons that RSVPed - Check in attendees.

Checked in attendees should be able to See;
- Total number of persons that RSVPed .
- Total number of attendees that checked in.
- Have a refund after checking in.

Payout is done automatically to the wallets of the checked in attendees after the event has ended.
